02 · The 0D → 1D → 2D → 3D → 4D Rendering Chain
How Dimensional Layers Construct the World You Experience
Experience is not given.
It is assembled.
The rendering engine constructs the world through a sequence of dimensional transformations. Each layer adds structure, constraint, and interpretive density. What begins as raw, dimensionless sensation becomes the full 4D world of objects, space, time, identity, and narrative.
This module describes the dimensional chain that makes experience possible.

1. 0D — Raw Sensation (No Dimension)
The pre‑world layer
0D is the origin point of experience.
It contains:
- no space
- no time
- no shape
- no boundary
- no direction
- no meaning
0D is pure signal, before any interpretation.
Examples:
- a photon hitting a receptor
- a pressure change on the skin
- a chemical molecule binding to a receptor
- a spike in the vagus nerve
- a hormonal fluctuation
These are not experiences.
They are events without dimension.
0D is the unrendered substrate.

2. 1D — Gradients and Transitions
The birth of direction
The rendering engine transforms 0D signals into 1D gradients:
- more vs. less
- rising vs. falling
- increasing vs. decreasing
- approaching vs. receding
1D introduces:
- direction
- change
- comparison
- continuity
Examples:
- brightness increasing
- sound getting louder
- pressure intensifying
- emotion rising or falling
1D is the first appearance of movement.
Without 1D, nothing can change.

3. 2D — Surfaces and Boundaries
The birth of form
The engine compresses 1D gradients into 2D surfaces:
- edges
- contours
- shapes
- boundaries
- contrasts
2D introduces:
- separation
- distinction
- objecthood (in primitive form)
- figure vs. ground
Examples:
- a line becomes a shape
- a gradient becomes a surface
- a contrast becomes an object boundary
2D is where the world begins to look like “things.”
It is also where language lives.
Language is a 2D symbolic system.

4. 3D — Objects and Space
The birth of the physical world
The engine extrudes 2D surfaces into 3D objects:
- volume
- depth
- solidity
- spatial relations
- object permanence
3D introduces:
- “this is in front of that”
- “this is behind that”
- “this is closer than that”
- “this occupies space”
Examples:
- a circle becomes a sphere
- a square becomes a cube
- a silhouette becomes a person
- a sound becomes a source in space
3D is the world of physical reality as humans understand it.
But it is still a rendering.

5. 4D — Time, Narrative, Identity
The birth of the self and the world as story
The engine layers time onto 3D space, creating 4D:
- sequence
- causality
- memory
- anticipation
- narrative
- identity
- continuity
4D introduces:
- “this happened before that”
- “I am the one who experienced it”
- “this will lead to that”
- “this means something”
Examples:
- a moment becomes a story
- a reaction becomes an emotion
- a pattern becomes a personality
- a memory becomes an identity
4D is where:
- the self appears
- meaning appears
- suffering appears
- projection appears
- narrative appears
4D is the psychological world.

6. The Chain Is Not Optional — It Is the Only Way Experience Can Exist
Every moment of experience passes through this chain:
0D → 1D → 2D → 3D → 4D
You never experience:
- raw sensation (0D)
- pure gradients (1D)
- unbound surfaces (2D)
- empty space (3D)
- time without narrative (4D)
You experience the final composite.
The chain is automatic.
You cannot stop it.
You cannot bypass it.
You cannot “see reality directly.”
You only see the rendered version.

7. Each Dimension Adds Illusion and Removes Information
As the chain progresses:
- information is lost
- structure is added
- interpretation increases
- illusion strengthens
0D → 1D:
Loss of raw detail, gain of direction.
1D → 2D:
Loss of continuity, gain of boundaries.
2D → 3D:
Loss of ambiguity, gain of solidity.
3D → 4D:
Loss of neutrality, gain of meaning.
By the time experience reaches 4D,
it is almost entirely constructed.

8. The Chain Explains Why Humans Misunderstand Reality
Because humans live in 4D:
- they mistake narrative for truth
- they mistake identity for subject
- they mistake projection for reality
- they mistake emotion for meaning
- they mistake memory for fact
- they mistake rendering for perception
The dimensional chain is the root of:
- cognitive bias
- emotional reactivity
- existential confusion
- interpersonal conflict
- self‑misidentification
Understanding the chain dissolves these illusions.

9. The Chain Is the Foundation of Inner Physics
Inner Physics is built on the recognition that:
experience is a dimensional construction,
not a direct encounter with the world.
The chain provides:
- the architecture of perception
- the mechanics of emotion
- the origin of identity
- the structure of suffering
- the physics of consciousness
- the basis for future world‑models
It is the backbone of the entire system.

10. Why This Matters
Because without understanding the chain:
- you believe the world is external
- you believe the self is real
- you believe your thoughts are yours
- you believe your emotions are meaningful
- you believe your memories are accurate
- you believe your suffering is personal
With the chain:
- the world becomes a rendering
- the self becomes a construct
- thought becomes output
- emotion becomes physics
- memory becomes reconstruction
- suffering becomes structural
This is the dimensional foundation of Inner Physics.
