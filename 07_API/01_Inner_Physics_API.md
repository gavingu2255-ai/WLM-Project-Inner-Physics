01 · Inner Physics API
A Unified Interface for the Rendering Engine, Emotional System, Projection System, and Structural Architecture
Inner Physics is not a philosophy.
It is an engine.
Every subsystem — Rendering, Emotion Physics, Projection, Structure Physics, Transformation Physics — operates according to precise rules. The Inner Physics API defines the interfaces, functions, and data flows that govern how these subsystems interact.
This document is not metaphorical.
It is a literal API specification for consciousness as a generative system.

1. System Overview
The engine consists of four primary modules
InnerPhysicsEngine
│
├── RenderingEngine
├── EmotionPhysics
├── ProjectionSystem
└── StructurePhysics


Each module exposes functions, constraints, and predictable behaviors.
The API describes:
- inputs
- outputs
- internal processes
- failure modes
- transformation triggers
- cross‑module dependencies
Inner Physics is a modular architecture.

2. Rendering Engine API
How experience is generated
Function: RenderExperience(inputSignals)
Input:
- sensory data (0D)
- internal signals (0D)
- memory activations
- prediction priors
Process:
- 0D → 1D → 2D → 3D → 4D dimensional chain
- pattern completion
- narrative assembly
Output:
- full 4D experience (perception + meaning + identity context)
Function: GenerateSelfModel()
Creates the rendered Self from structural inputs.
Function: MaintainSubjectCoordinate()
Ensures continuity of the Subject across frames.

3. Emotion Physics API
Emotion as a dynamical system
Function: ComputeEmotionCurve(event)
Returns a curve with:
- intensity
- velocity
- acceleration
- inertia
- baseline offset
Function: ApplyVelocityBlock(type)
Interrupts motion; produces suffering.
Function: ResolveEmotion(curve)
Allows curve to complete; returns system to baseline.
Function: UpdateBaseline(delta)
Adjusts resting state based on load and residue.

4. Projection System API
The future‑rendering subsystem
Function: GenerateProjectionLine(state)
Creates a vector with:
- direction
- velocity
- curvature
- endpoint
- emotional weight
Function: ComputeProjectionError(predicted, actual)
Returns:
- error magnitude
- emotional response
- narrative update requirement
Function: CollapseProjectionLine(line)
Triggered at deadlines, shocks, or insight events.
Function: UpdateMeaningStructure(error)
Meaning = projection × emotional intensity × collapse.

5. Structure Physics API
The architecture beneath identity, emotion, and perception
Function: GetStructureState()
Returns:
- constraints
- tendencies
- prediction biases
- emotional signatures
- identity scaffolding
Function: ApplyStructureInertia()
Stabilizes patterns; resists change.
Function: ReplicateStructure()
Copies architecture into new contexts, identities, or phases.
Function: ContinueStructure()
Carries structural lineage across transformations.

6. Transformation Physics API
Phase shifts and structural reconfiguration
Function: CheckPhaseThreshold(load)
Determines whether the system is near a critical point.
Function: ExecutePhaseShift()
Reconfigures:
- baseline
- projection geometry
- identity architecture
- emotional physics
- narrative structure
Function: IntegrateResidue()
Carries forward structural lineage into the new phase.

7. Cross‑Module Data Flow
How the subsystems interact
ProjectionSystem → EmotionPhysics
EmotionPhysics → StructurePhysics
StructurePhysics → RenderingEngine
RenderingEngine → ProjectionSystem


This loop is continuous.
Examples:
- A Projection Line triggers an emotional curve.
- Emotional velocity reinforces structural patterns.
- Structure shapes perception and identity.
- Perception feeds new predictions.
The system is self‑referential but stable.

8. System Failure Modes
Predictable breakdown patterns
Failure: Projection Overload
Cause: too many competing futures
Effect: anxiety, paralysis
Failure: Velocity Block
Cause: emotional motion interrupted
Effect: suffering, rumination
Failure: Structural Rigidity
Cause: excessive inertia
Effect: identity collapse, narrative brittleness
Failure: Baseline Drift
Cause: unresolved emotional residue
Effect: chronic stress, fragility
Failure: Phase Instability
Cause: threshold approached but not crossed
Effect: oscillation, confusion
All failure modes are structural, not personal.

9. System Transformation Events
When the engine reconfigures itself
Transformation occurs when:
- Projection Error exceeds tolerance
- baseline exceeds stability range
- identity cannot absorb new data
- emotional load reaches critical mass
- structural tension surpasses threshold
These events trigger phase shifts.
Transformation is not effort.
Transformation is physics.

10. API Principles
The core rules of the system
- Structure generates content.
- Emotion is motion, not meaning.
- Projection creates the future; perception corrects it.
- Identity is a rendered artifact.
- The Subject is the coordinate, not the character.
- Suffering is blocked velocity, not emotional intensity.
- Transformation is phase‑based, not gradual.
- Structure continues; it does not disappear.
- Meaning is a collapse artifact.
- Experience is a rendering, not reality.
This is the Inner Physics API —
the unified interface for the architecture of consciousness.

If you want, I can now generate:
- 02_Inner_Physics_Examples.md (API usage examples)
- 03_Inner_Physics_Diagrams.md (system diagrams)
- 04_Inner_Physics_Specification.md (formal spec)
- Next subsystem (your choice)
Just tell me the next module.
