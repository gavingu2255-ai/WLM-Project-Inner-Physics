# WLM Shadow Layer License 1.0
(Structure Visible · Protocol Sealed · No Implementation Rights)

## 1. Scope
This license applies to the **WLM Project — Inner Physics**, including all structural descriptions, dimensional models, rendering mechanisms, subject architecture, emotion physics, projection physics, structure physics, life‑death cycle models, diagrams, conceptual frameworks, and any other non‑executable materials contained in this repository.

Inner Physics is part of the **WLM Shadow Layer**.  
It is a **structural world‑model**, not an implementation specification.

## 2. Permissions (Read‑Only)
You may:

- Read the Inner Physics Shadow Layer  
- Cite or reference it for academic or theoretical work  
- Discuss or analyze its concepts  
- Use it for non‑commercial research  

These permissions apply **only** to the Shadow Layer.

---

## 3. Prohibitions (Strict)
You may **not**:

- Implement Inner Physics  
- Train models using Inner Physics structures  
- Reconstruct, approximate, or simulate Inner Physics logic  
- Create derivative world‑models or dimensional frameworks  
- Build compatibility layers  
- Use Inner Physics for commercial purposes  
- Develop software, models, or systems based on Inner Physics  
- Reverse‑engineer dimensional physics  
- Infer or simulate the Implementation Layer  
- Operationalize any part of the Inner Physics protocol  

Any attempt to operationalize Inner Physics is strictly prohibited.

---

## 4. No Access to Protocol Layer
This license does **not** grant access to:

- The 160,000‑word Implementation Layer  
- Routing rules  
- Dimensional syntax  
- Execution logic  
- Training formats  
- Model interfaces  
- Commercial integration pathways  

Inner Physics is **structural**, not operational.

---

## 5. No Derivative Works
You may not modify, adapt, extend, translate, transform, or repackage any part of Inner Physics.

---

## 6. No Commercial Use
Commercial use of any kind is prohibited.

---

## 7. No Warranty
Inner Physics is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind.

---

## 8. Source Boundary
Structure may be studied;  
**source may not be derived.**

Dimensional behavior may be observed;  
**protocol may not be reconstructed.**

---

## 9. Jurisdiction
This license is governed by the laws of **Australia**.
